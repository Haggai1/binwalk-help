# binwalk-help
I’m trying to do a recuse analysis using a Linux script and I can’t figure it out how to code it since a you can’t do a recursive scan on directory
I ran foremost and while I'm coding my script I can't run binwalk on my script.
I tried to manually cd into the foremost directory and run binwalk but that just won't work 
Any suggestions pleas?
